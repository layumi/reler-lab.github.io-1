Task 1: Drone-view target localization. (Drone -> Satellite)} Given one drone-view image or video, the task aims to find the most similar satellite-view image to localize the target building in the satellite view.

Task 2: Drone navigation. (Satellite -> Drone)} Given one satellite-view image, the drone intends to find the most relevant place (drone-view images) that it has passed by. According to its flight history, the drone could be navigated back to the target place.
